titleDevanagri: "श्री ब्रह्म सूक्तम्"
titleEnglish: "Shri Brahma Suktam"

description: "The Brahma Sūktam is found both in the Atharva Vēda and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. This text deals with the glory of the Supreme Being. The Brahma Sūktam is used during the famous ritual Udakaśānti. The Udakaśānti is very prevalent and well known to many.
It is performed before Upanayana where Varuṇa is invoked in the waters and later the same water is poured on the people who are getting their Upanaya done, this is the same for all the Samskāras.
Some even do daily Pārāyaṇa of this Mantra, but normally it is used mainly in the rituals."
